#### Went well
- Completed MVP
- three way teamwork
- extracting cell logic

## Day 4 06-02-2020

- Variable rules within conways GoL
- Variable rulesets
- Saving state of map

### Blockers
Retrieving form data
Inter component communication

### Learning Resources
- https://jestjs.io/docs/en/mock-functions

### Retros

#### Went poorly / could improve
React!
Feature/Unit testing in Enzyme/Jest
Harry's humour
Lack of bread
Lacok of Ambition
Separation of concerns in React
Miscalulation of complexity of each task - could have used the trello board to seperate tasks into smaller ones (T-shirt size method)
Need to ask coaches for more help

#### Went well
Bob Marley
Dawid - map size/add description and title to page

## First Sprint 

- First sprint not ambitious enough, would like to see more.
- Look into Smart and Dumb components (for rendering the components)
- Second sprint too ambitious

### plans for next sprint

- play/pause
- Title and explanation about cellular automata on the page
- Integrate Cell Logic

## Direction
- Game-ify: - snakes? 
            - kill off/survive 
            - change of environment
            - user moves as it iterates
            - saving board (using backend)
